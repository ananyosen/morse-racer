        "But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?' '_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor. 'It is simply this.",
        "That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others.",
        "Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here.",
        "Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.'"
